## Development Guide

### Adding New Districts
Edit `src/data/karnatakaDistricts.js` with new district data structure.

### Customizing Crop/Tree Options
Update `CROP_CONFIG` and `TREE_CONFIG` in `src/App.jsx`.

### Translating to New Languages
1. Add language object in `src/i18n.js`
2. Provide all translation keys
3. Update language toggle in components

### Modifying AI Prompts
Edit the Gemini prompt in `src/App.jsx` `handleSubmit()` function for different recommendations.
